This is a project for participation in TechAxom Hackathon organised in AEC

#PS: Meet-up platform by interests for Social activities 

Due to different departments and courses, interaction with different students 
from other departments or courses is difficult. To increase socialization in a 
campus different social events or a platform must be provided so that students 
can interact with each other and create a healthy socialize campus. 
To tackle this issue we have come up with an idea, in which we will be making a 
website which will allow users to play games with random student within the 
college, for now we will be implementing a game in which a room will be 
created and max 4 random people will be allowed to join it, in the room every 
player gets a random word one by one in different round, which will not be 
shown to other player, and the word decider player will be provided with a 
canvas in which he/she can provide some hints to guess the word, it will also 
have in game voice chat but the word decider player will not be to speak in that 
round, so that other players can discuss among themselves, this will help to 
increase socialization among random students in a fun way. And the website 
will also have some groups based on tags which are required in college, with this 
like-minded people can discuss about some topics or organize some social event 
in the campus. 
This project will also have further scalable ways in future like- 
- Having a weekly leaderboard based on social score and provide few 
-eward system (to motivate students join the platform and interact). 
- Add more different games to attract more students to play. 
- Add Post Board based on interest so that interested group of students on 
certain topic can organize events. 
- Adding Singing or dance video or any talent showcase section to promote 
their own talent within the campus.
